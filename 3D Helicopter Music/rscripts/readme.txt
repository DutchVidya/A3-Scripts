WHY SO MANY FILES DUDE?

Honestly, because this was difficult. I need essentially a script for every new vehicle to have do music in 3D.
So yes, there are 2 files for Gimme Shelter and so on.

If someone comes up with a way to fix my issue with the invisible helipads, I'm all ears. 

Eseentially what happens is if the pilot clicks another song without ending the other first, it creates a second 
invisible helipad to attach and play in 3D from. Unfortunately, the stop script can only remove the latest helipad.

 I have no idea how to fix it so the stop script ends everything. If you do, let me know, please.
