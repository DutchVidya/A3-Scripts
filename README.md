# The Project Awesome Script Package

Originally just for my scripts (me, DutchVidya). Not long after making this git people started coming forward with ideas, recommendations and tweaks. So I guess this is as close to a PA Script pack as you can get.

All of these should be capable of running seperately, or even together, so some will maybe have overlap in what they do.
