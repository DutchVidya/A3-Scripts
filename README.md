# The Project Awesome Script Package

Originally just for my scripts (me, DutchVidya). Not long after making this git people started coming forward with ideas, recommendations and tweaks. So I guess this is as close to a PA Script pack as you can get.

All of these should be capable of running seperately, or even together, so some will maybe have overlap in what they do.

This script pack is in no way "offical", at the moment, other than it being a few dudes in PA hocking together nonesense like iPods and Suicide Vests. If it does beocme official thouhg, Oh boy!
