# A3 Scripts

These scripts are either built by myself from scratch, or were cobbled together on the work of people much better than I.
A lot of these are actually old Arma 2 scripts, brought back to life for Arma 3. I do not take credit for everything, and hell, 
I don't even understand all of them, but I will place every script I use up here for those who want them.

I have a philosophy for Arma: that it is first and foremost a video game. It should be fun, it should make people smile. I aim to
bring a lighthearted sense of joy to what is an otherwise hardcore Infantry Simulator.
