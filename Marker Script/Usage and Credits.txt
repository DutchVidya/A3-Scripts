Script By : mbetts

USAGE

- Place the code from init.sqf file at the bottom of your init.sqf

- rm1 is the marker

- r1 is the unit

Limitations 

- If the object gets placed inside another vehicle the script no longer works, it however still works if it is a backpack and is placed on a person.

- As the code is a while() loop it may not work with other init scripts
